
Another way to reduce memory overhead and heap fragmentation is by allowing raw 
structs. What I mean is that not every struct is allocated on the heap.

This is more of an advanced feature because it breaks some of the language 
semantics.

struct Vec2
{
	x: num,
	y: num,
}

struct Player
{
	position: raw Vec2,
	velocity: raw Vec2,
}

proc main()
{
	var player = new(Player);
	player.position = raw(Vec2);
}

Aside from this, I want to make some more basic value types to avoid this first,
like vec2, vec3, vec4, vec2i, vec3i, vec4i
