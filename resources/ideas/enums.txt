This is a feature that I will definitely add ad some point. 
I think just using the they way enums work on Odin is good enough.

enum PlayerState
{
	None,
	Standing,
	Crouching,
	Jumping,
}

struct Player
{
	state: PlayerState,
}

proc test_enums()
{
	var player = new(Player);
	player.state = .Standing;
	player.state = PlayerState.Crouching;

	var defined_state: PlayerState = .Jumping;
	// If the enum type is not known, you will need to specify
	var loose_state = PlayerState.Jumping;
}
